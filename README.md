### Father's Day Digital Card
I wanted to create an free hosted father's day card based off the valentines day card I'd created in the past. 
View the card [HERE](https://mindfultatiana.github.io/fathersday2024/)

### Problem: 
Digitally bridging the distance and making something custom. 
-  I wanted something I could send a link from that was a bit more interactive.
-  I wanted it more custom than the digital card creators.

### What I learned:
Sometimes it's better to just get rid of the shadow and use the same color than delete a box entirely.

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages, Prettier

## Steps
### Step 1
Figure out how to make the use files and knowledge from the Valentines Day card:
  - I started off by getting ideas from a tutorial by Jonah Lawrence [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVX7kZ4GM-g). 
  - That taught how to do a Happy Birthday card.
### Step 2
Make alterations to customize it:
-  I changed the colors, text, and image to be about Father's Day.
-  I added an image from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/fathers-day-happy-father-dad-8039365/)

### Step 3
Add music player to webpage:
-  I found a public domain song "Upbeat Energy Happy Folk" by stock_music available [Here](https://pixabay.com/music/happy-childrens-tunes-upbeat-energy-happy-folk-157754/).

### Step 4
Set up GitHub Pages
-  I followed instructions on how to create the GitHub Page [Here](https://pages.github.com/) and [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
-  It's launched and it looks amazing!
